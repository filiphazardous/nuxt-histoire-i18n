# Nuxt 3 + Histoire + @nuxtsjs/i18n sandbox

## What is this?
This is a proof of concept testing combinations of packages.

## What can I use it for?
If you need most of the same packages, fork this, add/remove until it meets your requirements. Use it as a base to demo
bugs in underlying packages. Find workarounds.

## Notes on versions
As of July 2024, all versions are current except @nuxtjs/i18n, due to an incompatibility with later versions. If
someone wants to fix that incompatibility, this setup could demo that it's working.
